# Project Overview
Search Engine from scratch. Crawled 50,000+ links to create an inverted index. The inverted index consists of words, in which URL's containing them were scored based on tf-idf weighting. User can query a sentence to get the most relevant URL results. Scoring methods weren't as comprehensive as googles but I am happy with what I learned
